## ðŸŽ¨ Key Figures

### Figure 3: [../figures/platelet-transcriptional-changes.png]
**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Temporal Resolution:** First study to capture platelet transcriptional changes within a 6-hour critical window post-sepsis diagnosis
- **Multi-pathway Integration:** Simultaneously tracks coagulation, activation, metabolism (OXPHOS/glycolysis), and immune pathways
- **Disease Severity Correlation:** Clear progression of platelet dysfunction from healthy â†’ survivor â†’ non-survivor states
- **COVID-19 Convergence:** Identifies shared platelet pathways between sepsis and severe COVID-19, suggesting common mechanisms

**Design principles to mimic:**
- Temporal boxplot comparisons (T0 vs T6) across patient groups
- Pathway module scoring approach for functional interpretation
- Statistical significance overlay with multiple comparison correction
- Color-coded condition grouping for clear visual distinction

### Figure 5: [monocyte-immunosuppression.png]
**Immunological excellence:**
- **Dynamic Immunosuppression:** Captures the transition from hyperinflammation to immune paralysis within hours
- **Metabolic-Immune Coupling:** Links HIF1A expression to OXPHOS/glycolysis shifts and functional outcomes
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Identifies NAMPT as consistently upregulated in fatal cases but downregulated in survivors
- **Clinical Correlation:** HLA-DR downregulation at T6 in fatal cases confirms immune suppression

## ðŸ”„ Key Scientific Insights

```python
### 1. Conceptual Innovation

  2. **Non-survivors Early Stage (NS ES):** Fatal within 30 days
  3. **Non-survivors Late Stage (NS LS):** Fatal within 24h
  4. **Healthy Controls (HC):** 2 volunteers

### 3. Validation Strategy
**Comprehensive Evaluation Across:**
- **5 sepsis patients** with Gram-negative bacterial infection
- **57,133 cells** spanning 11 immune cell types
- **Temporal sampling** at diagnosis and 6h post-diagnosis
- **Clinical correlation** with qSOFA, APACHE scores, and cytokine levels

- **Mechanistic Studies:** Functional validation of identified pathways and biomarkers
- **Therapeutic Testing:** Targeting platelet dysfunction and immune paralysis

### Current Limitations
- **Sample Size:** 5 sepsis patients limits statistical power and generalizability
- **Gram-negative Focus:** Results may not extend to Gram-positive or viral sepsis
- **PBMC Limitation:** Neutrophils largely excluded due to technical constraints
- **Gender Effects:** Small sample size prevents comprehensive gender analysis

### Open Questions
- Do these 6-hour signatures predict long-term outcomes in survivors?
- Can therapeutic intervention modify these immune trajectories?
- How do these patterns differ across sepsis etiologies and patient populations?
