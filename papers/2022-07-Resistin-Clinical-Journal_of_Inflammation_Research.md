### Figure 4: Resistin association with all-cause mortality
![Resistin Mortality Association](../../../paper-figures/resistin-mortality-kaplan-meier.png)

**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Powerful prognostic visualization:** Demonstrates clear separation between high and low resistin groups using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with statistical significance (p < 0.001)
- **Clinically actionable thresholds:** Establishes specific cutoff values (>126 ng/mL at T0, >197 ng/mL at T24-high) that can be immediately implemented in clinical practice
- **Temporal specificity:** Shows both early recognition (T0) and 24-hour peak measurements, providing flexibility for clinical decision-making
- **Strong statistical power:** Area under curve values of 0.82 and 0.88 demonstrate excellent predictive capability comparable to established clinical scores

**Design principles to mimic:**
- Clear threshold-based stratification for binary clinical outcomes
- Integration of time-series biomarker data with survival analysis
- Multiple timepoint validation of the same biomarker
- Statistical annotation with p-values and confidence intervals

  1. **Primary endpoint:** All-cause mortality at 60 days with interim analysis at 30 days
  2. **Secondary endpoints:** Correlation with SOFA, mSOFA, APACHE II scores
  3. **Comparator analysis:** Gram-negative vs non-gram-negative sepsis etiology
  4. **RNA validation:** Cross-validation with publicly available sepsis RNA expression datasets
