![Immune Subtypes Differences](../../../paper-figures/immune-subtypes-differences.png)

**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Gender-specific patterns:** Clear visualization of how smoking affects immune subtypes differently in males vs. females across cancer types
- **Statistical rigor:** Systematic comparison using Mann-Whitney U tests with significance thresholds clearly marked
- **Clinical relevance:** Shows C1 (wound healing) overabundance and C2 (IFN-Î³ dominant) underabundance specifically in female smokers
- **Comprehensive scope:** Pan-cancer analysis across 10 TCGA cancer types with consistent methodology

**Design principles to mimic:**
- Multi-panel layout showing individual cancer types and pan-cancer summary
- Color-coded smoking status (current, former, never smokers) 
- Statistical significance overlay with p-value annotations
- Gender-stratified analysis presentation
