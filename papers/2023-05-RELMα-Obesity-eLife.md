## ðŸŽ¨ Key Figures

### Figure 1: [relma-obesity-protection.png]
**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Sex-specific Protection:** Demonstrates that RELMÎ± deficiency specifically affects female obesity protection, not males
- **Multi-parameter Analysis:** Integrates body weight, adipose mass, cytokine levels, and immune cell frequencies
- **Temporal Resolution:** Shows progressive weight gain over 12-15 weeks with clear divergence in RELMÎ± KO females
- **Flow Cytometry Integration:** Links phenotypic changes to specific immune cell population shifts in stromal vascular fraction

**Design principles to mimic:**
- Multi-panel design combining weight curves, tissue masses, and cellular analysis
- Sex-stratified analysis with clear male/female comparisons throughout
- Time-course data presentation with error bars and statistical annotations
- Integration of phenotypic and immunological readouts
