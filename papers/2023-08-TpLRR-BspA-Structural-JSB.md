## ðŸŽ¨ Key Figures

### Figure 1: tplrr-comparison-structures.png
![Structural comparison of classical LRR vs TpLRR proteins](../../../paper-figures/tplrr-comparison-structures.png)

**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Paradigm-breaking visualization:** Clearly demonstrates the revolutionary "flipped curvature" where beta sheets are on the convex (outside) rather than concave (inside) of the torus
- **Cross-class structural comparison:** Shows classical RI-LRR (2BNH), TpLRR prototype (6MLX), and BspA-like protein (4FS7) side-by-side with identical orientation
- **Secondary structure mapping:** Both cartoon and detailed residue views reveal the absence of helices on the concave side, replaced by irregular secondary structure
- **Evolutionary significance:** Demonstrates how a single protein family violates the established "rules" of LRR protein architecture

### Figure 2: solenoid-curvature-analysis.png
![Side view analysis of solenoid curvature differences](../../../paper-figures/solenoid-curvature-analysis.png)

**Quantitative structural excellence:**
- **Precise distance measurements:** Shows 8Ã… spacing in classical LRR vs 4-5Ã… in TpLRR proteins, explaining curvature inversion
- **Geometric principle demonstration:** Illustrates how changing outer edge distances controls solenoid curvature
- **Design rule validation:** Confirms the structural basis for the dramatic curvature changes observed
- **Comparative methodology:** Uses consistent measurement approaches across different protein classes

## ðŸ”„ Key Scientific Insights

```python
### 1. Conceptual Innovation
- **Curvature Inversion Discovery:** First demonstration of LRR proteins with beta sheets on convex rather than concave side of torus structure
- **Conservation Pattern Revolution:** TpLRR pattern (C/NxxLxxIxLxxxLxxIgxxAFxx) differs fundamentally from canonical LxxLxLxxN/C pattern
- **Functional Paradigm Shift:** Unlike RI-LRRs that bind diverse ligands via rigid cavities, TpLRR proteins evolved to bind specific targets (TLR2) with modular additional domains

### 2. Methodological Framework
- **Structure-Function Correlation:** Links sequence conservation patterns directly to 3D structural features and functional outcomes
- **Multi-scale Analysis Strategy:** Combines individual protein structures, family-wide sequence analysis, and phylogenetic distribution studies
- **Classification Refinement:**
  1. **TpLRR class:** Linear or reversed curvature (1,745 examples in UniRef50)
  2. **BspA subclass:** Specific TLR2-binding motif GC(S/T)GLXSIT
  3. **Domain architecture patterns:** 15% contain Ig-like domains, 5% dockerin domains
  4. **Pathogen association:** Strong enrichment in oral, intestinal, and genital tract pathogens

### 3. Validation Strategy
**Comprehensive Evaluation Across:**
- **8 experimental structures** spanning multiple bacterial species
- **1,745 TpLRR family members** from UniRef50 database analysis
- **Multiple pathogen systems** (T. forsythia, T. denticola, E. histolytica, T. vaginalis)
- **Functional studies** confirming TLR2 interactions and immune modulation
```

## ðŸ”¬ Critical Technical Details
```python
### 1. Structural Architecture Analysis

# Key curvature measurements:
- Classical LRR (RI): 8Ã… spacing between outer edges
- TpLRR: 5Ã… spacing (linear topology)
- BspA-like: 4Ã… spacing (reversed curvature)
- Beta sheet distance: 5Ã… (consistent across all classes)

### 2. Sequence Conservation Patterns
- **Classical pattern:** LxxLxLxx[NC] - leucines pointing inward, stabilizing concave side
- **TpLRR pattern:** C/NxxLxxIxLxxxLxxIgxxAFxx - reduced beta-side conservation, new concave-side positions
- **BspA motif:** GC(S/T)GLXSIT - specific TLR2 interaction sequence

### 3. Domain Architecture Statistics
- **Single LRR domain:** Most common architecture
- **Tandem LRR domains:** Present in 3/6 experimental structures with identical inter-domain angles
- **Ig-like domains:** 15% of proteins (up to 20 copies in some proteins)
- **Dockerin domains:** 5% of proteins (cell attachment function)
```
