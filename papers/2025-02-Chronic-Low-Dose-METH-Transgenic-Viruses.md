## ðŸŽ¨ Key Figures

### Figure 2: Behavioral Assessment Results
![Learning and spatial memory impairment](../../../paper-figures/figure-2-behavioral-results.png)

**Why this figure is exceptional:**
- **Sex-dependent effects demonstration:** Clear visualization of how males and females respond differently to Tat and METH exposure across multiple behavioral paradigms
- **Unexpected protective effect:** Shows that Tat + METH combination actually improved spatial memory performance compared to individual treatments
- **Comprehensive behavioral battery:** Integrates locomotor activity, Barnes maze (spatial memory), and novel object recognition (short-term memory) in a single comprehensive view
- **Statistical rigor:** Proper statistical analysis with clear significance indicators and appropriate controls

### Figure 4: Histopathological Quantification
![Quantitative histological analysis](../../../paper-figures/figure-4-histology-quantification.png)

**Neuropathological excellence:**
- **Multi-marker approach:** Simultaneous assessment of synaptic terminals (synaptophysin), dendrites (MAP2), astrocytes (GFAP), and microglia (Iba1)
- **Regional specificity:** Separate analysis of cortex and hippocampus reveals brain region-dependent effects
- **Sex-stratified analysis:** Demonstrates clear sexual dimorphism in neuroinflammatory responses
- **Protective mechanism insight:** Shows unexpected preservation of presynaptic terminals in male cortex with combined treatment


## ðŸ”„ Key Scientific Insights

```python
### 1. Conceptual Innovation
- **Sexual Dimorphism in NeuroHIV:** First demonstration of sex-dependent responses to chronic low-dose METH in HIV-1 Tat transgenic model
- **Dose-dependent Neuroprotection:** Evidence that chronic low-dose METH can ameliorate some HIV-1 Tat-induced deficits
- **Long-term Persistence:** Effects persist 5+ months after final METH exposure, indicating lasting neuroadaptations

### 2. Methodological Framework
- **iTat Transgenic Model:** Inducible HIV-1 Tat expression under GFAP promoter with doxycycline control
- **Chronic Low-dose Regimen:** 12-week escalating then maintenance METH protocol (0.5-2.5 mg/kg s.c., 5 days/week)
- **Treatment Groups:**
  1. **Control:** GFAP-rtTA+ only, vehicle treatment
  2. **Tat:** GFAP-rtTA+/pTRE-Tat+, vehicle treatment  
  3. **METH:** GFAP-rtTA+ only, METH treatment
  4. **Tat + METH:** GFAP-rtTA+/pTRE-Tat+, METH treatment

### 3. Validation Strategy
**Comprehensive Multi-modal Assessment:**
- **83 mice total** spanning both sexes and all treatment groups
- **Behavioral Battery:** Barnes maze, novel object recognition, locomotor activity, optomotor, light/dark transfer
- **Histopathological Analysis:** Synaptophysin, MAP2, GFAP, Iba1 immunofluorescence in cortex and hippocampus
- **Gene Expression:** qRT-PCR for AD-related genes, RNA-seq for hippocampal transcriptome analysis

## ðŸ”¬ Critical Technical Details
```python
### 1. Animal Model and Treatment Protocol

# iTat transgenic mouse characteristics:
- Bigenic system: GFAP-rtTA+/pTRE-Tat+ for inducible Tat expression
- Doxycycline induction: 100 mg/kg i.p. for 7 days during week 4
- METH regimen: Escalating 0.5-2.5 mg/kg s.c., then maintenance 2.5 mg/kg, 5 days/week Ã— 12 weeks
- Timeline: Treatment at 4 months age, behavioral testing at 11-12 months age

### 2. Behavioral Assessment Battery
- **Barnes Maze:** Spatial learning and memory (4-day acquisition + probe test)
- **Novel Object Recognition:** Short-term memory and discrimination
- **Locomotor Activity:** 120-minute assessment with horizontal and vertical beam breaks
- **Optomotor:** Visual capacity assessment with rotating striped drum
- **Light/Dark Transfer:** Anxiety-like behavior measurement

### 3. Key Findings by Sex
- **Males:** METH increased locomotor activity; Tat + METH protected spatial memory and cortical synapses
- **Females:** Tat severely impaired novel object recognition; METH alone improved NOR performance
- **Combined:** Tat disrupted spatial memory in both sexes; METH modulated Tat effects differently by sex

## ðŸ’­ Critical Research Implications
```python
### 1. Methodological Impact
- **Sex-stratified Analysis Imperative:** Demonstrates that combining sexes in neuroHIV studies masks critical biological differences
- **Dose-dependency of METH Effects:** Challenges binary "toxic vs. therapeutic" view of methamphetamine in neurological contexts
- **Long-term Assessment Value:** Shows that acute treatment effects may not predict long-term outcomes

### 2. NeuroHIV Relevance
- **Comorbidity Modeling:** First study to systematically examine METH-HIV interactions with chronic low-dose exposure paradigm
- **Therapeutic Potential:** Suggests possibility that controlled METH dosing might ameliorate some HIV-associated cognitive deficits
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Identifies sex-specific molecular signatures that could guide personalized treatment approaches

### 3. Neuroscience Insights
- **Neuroprotective Paradox:** Demonstrates that combined neurotoxic exposures can sometimes produce protective effects
- **Regional Specificity:** Shows that different brain regions and memory systems respond uniquely to HIV and drug exposure

## ðŸ”— Related Work & Context
- **Predecessor Method:** Previous iTat mouse studies focused on acute effects and used only males or didn't stratify by sex
- **Competing Approach:** High-dose METH binge models vs. this chronic low-dose approach shows opposite effects
- **Complementary Work:** Links to broader literature on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and substance use comorbidities
