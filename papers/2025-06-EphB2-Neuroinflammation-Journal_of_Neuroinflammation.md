## ðŸ”¬ Critical Technical Details
```python
### 1. EphB2/Ephrin-B1 Signaling Architecture

# Key pathway components:
- EphB2 receptor: Upregulated in PLWH brain pathology, correlates with viral load
- Ephrin-B1 ligand: Induced on microglia by IFNÎ², mediates reverse signaling
- NF-ÎºB activation: ~7-fold increase in phosphorylation following EphB2 treatment
- IRF7 regulation: Acts as negative feedback regulator of pathway

### 2. Neuroinflammatory Response Profile
- **Pro-inflammatory factors:** IL-6, TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², CCL2, CXCL10, MMP-9
- **Anti-viral signature:** IRF7, IFITM3, RIG-I, MX2, IFI35, IFIT1
- **Neurotoxic outcome:** 32% reduction in neuronal survival with EphB2-conditioned media

### 3. Therapeutic Intervention Points
- **Ephrin-B1 knockdown:** ~50% reduction in expression, partial neuroprotection
- **IFNÎ² treatment:** Overcomes neurotoxicity despite pathway activation
- **IRF7 modulation:** Paradoxical increase in EphB2 expression when knocked down
